Notes from 28 Nov 2016

This repo contains three related projects:

(1) Analysis of buds as collected by Jehane Samaha in the winter of 2014-2015 (note, right now there are just quick analyses of the data as of May 2015; best to check drive and weldshare and ‘where datacode live’ for more data). 

(2) Analysis related to the photo x chill x forcing twig/cutting experiment lead by Dan Flynn in winter 2014-2015. As of today, most of what you see relates to this. Note: All light information is organized on WeldShare: Wolkovich Lab/Budburst Experiment 2015/README_chambers

(3) Stuff related to the chilling experiment Dan Flynn did in winter 2015-2016.
